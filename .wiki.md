# Project Summary
The "MateCode" project is a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension designed to enhance developer productivity by integrating AI-generated code snippets directly into their coding environment. Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM), this tool streamlines workflows and reduces manual coding efforts. The extension features configurable options to improve user experience, including a diff preview, one-click undo functionality, automatic code formatting, and a sidebar for tracking code history. 

# Project Module Description
The main functionalities of the VS Code extension include:
- Reading and parsing code blocks from clipboard text or selected editor content.
- Identifying relevant file paths for the code blocks.
- Confirming with the user before overwriting existing files.
- Creating necessary directories and writing the code to specified files.
- Automatically opening the first five created or updated files in the editor.
- Applying code to open files using the shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+D).
- Enhanced support for Python, HTML, JavaScript, and Bash.
- **Smart Partial Code Updates**: Intelligent handling of partial code changes suggested by LLMs.
- **Configurable Features**:
  - **Diff Preview**: Side-by-side comparison before applying changes.
  - **One-Click Undo**: Easily revert applied changes.
  - **Auto Formatting/Linting**: Automatic code formatting after applying changes.
  - **Sidebar History View**: Track and restore previous code applications.
